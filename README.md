This project contains three puzzles; astro, clock , and dice. They are all in the folders with the same listed names. 
I had to implement the breadth first search to get the solution for each puzzle with the fewest steps taken.
The common solver that uses the BFS to solve the puzzles is under the 'common' folder.
